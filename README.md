# OdinProject-Landing-Page

## About This Project

This project is a landing page built from scratch based on a design provided by The Odin Project as part of their Foundations Course. The goal was to recreate the visual layout and styling using HTML and CSS, with a strong emphasis on using Flexbox for layout.

The design aims for a common webpage structure, featuring a header, a hero section, an information section with cards, a quote section, a call-to-action section, and a footer.

## Key Learnings & Skills Practiced

* Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML.
* Styling elements using CSS, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
